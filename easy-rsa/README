This is a small RSA key management package,
based on the openssl command line tool, that
can be found in the easy-rsa subdirectory
of the OpenVPN distribution.

INSTALL

1. Edit vars.
2. Set KEY_CONFIG to point to the openssl.cnf file
   included in this distribution.
3. Set KEY_DIR to point to a directory which will
   contain all keys, certificates, etc.  This
   directory need not exist, and if it does,
   it will be deleted with rm -rf, so BE
   CAREFUL how you set KEY_DIR.
4. (Optional) Edit other fields in vars
   per your site data.  You may want to
   increase KEY_SIZE to 2048 if you are
   paranoid and don't mind slower key
   processing, but certainly 1024 is
   fine for testing purposes.  KEY_SIZE
   must be compatible across both peers
   participating in a secure SSL/TLS
   connection.
5  . vars
6. ./clean-all
7. As you create certificates, keys, and
   certificate signing requests, understand that
   only .key files should be kept confidential.
   .crt and .csr files can be sent over insecure
   channels such as plaintext email.
8. You should never need to copy a .key file
   between computers.  Normally each computer
   will have its own certificate/key pair.

BUILD YOUR OWN ROOT CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY (CA) CERTIFICATE/KEY

1. ./build-ca
2. ca.crt and ca.key will be built in your KEY_DIR
   directory

BUILD AN INTERMEDIATE CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY CERTIFICATE/KEY

1. ./build-inter inter
2. inter.crt and inter.key will be built in your KEY_DIR
   directory and signed with your root certificate.

BUILD DIFFIE-HELLMAN PARAMETERS (necessary for
the server end of a SSL/TLS connection).

1. ./build-dh

BUILD A CERTIFICATE SIGNING REQUEST (If
you want to sign your certificate with a root
certificate controlled by another individual
or organization, or residing on a different machine).

1. Get ca.crt (the root certificate) from your
   certificate authority.  Though this
   transfer can be over an insecure channel, to prevent
   man-in-the-middle attacks you must confirm that
   ca.crt was not tampered with.  Large CAs solve this
   problem by hardwiring their root certificates into
   popular web browsers.  A simple way to verify a root
   CA is to call the issuer on the telephone and confirm
   that the md5sum or sha1sum signatures on the ca.crt
   files match (such as with the command: "md5sum ca.crt").
2. Choose a name for your certificate such as your computer
   name.  In our example we will use "deception".
3. ./build-req deception
4. You can ignore most of the fields, but set
   "Common Name" to something unique such as your
   computer's host name.  Leave all password
   fields blank, unless you want your private key
   to be protected by password.  Using a password
   is not required -- it will make your key more secure
   but also more inconvenient to use, because you will
   need to supply your password anytime the key is used.
   NOTE: if you are using a password, use ./build-req-pass
   instead of ./build-req
5. Your key will be written to $KEY_DIR/deception.key
6. Your certificate signing request will be written to
   to $KEY_DIR/deception.csr
7. Email deception.csr to the individual or organization
   which controls the root certificate.  This can be
   done over an insecure channel.
8. After the .csr file is signed by the root certificate
   authority, you will receive a file deception.crt
   (your certificate).  Place deception.crt in your
   KEY_DIR directory.
9. The combined files of deception.crt, deception.key,
   and ca.crt can now be used to secure one end of
   an SSL/TLS connection.

SIGN A CERTIFICATE SIGNING REQUEST

1. ./sign-req deception
2. deception.crt will be built in your KEY_DIR
   directory using deception.csr and your root CA
   file as input.

BUILD AND SIGN A CERTIFICATE SIGNING REQUEST
USING A LOCALLY INSTALLED ROOT CERTIFICATE/KEY -- this
script generates and signs a certificate in one step,
but it requires that the generated certificate and private
key files be copied to the destination host over a
secure channel.

1. ./build-key deception (no password protection)
2. OR ./build-key-pass deception (with password protection)
3. deception.crt and deception.key will be built in your
   KEY_DIR directory, and deception.crt will be signed
   by your root CA.
