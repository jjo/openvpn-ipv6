.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
OpenVPN is a robust and highly configurable VPN (Virtual Private Network)
daemon which can be used to securely link two or more private networks
using an encrypted tunnel over the Internet. OpenVPN's principal strengths
include wide cross-platform portability, excellent stability,
support for dynamic IP addresses and NAT, adaptive link compression,
single TCP/UDP port usage, a modular design that offloads most crypto
tasks to the OpenSSL library, and relatively easy installation that in
most cases doesn't require a special kernel module.

OpenVPN is tightly bound to the OpenSSL library, and derives much
of its crypto capabilities from it.

OpenVPN supports
conventional encryption
using a pre-shared secret key
.B (Static Key mode)
or
public key security
.B (SSL/TLS mode)
using client & server certificates.
OpenVPN also
supports non-encrypted TCP/UDP tunnels.  

OpenVPN is designed to work with the
.B TUN/TAP
virtual networking interface that exists on most platforms.

Overall, OpenVPN aims to offer many of the key features of IPSec but
with a relatively lightweight footprint.
.SH OPTIONS
OpenVPN allows any option to be placed either on the command line
or in a configuration file.  Though all command line options are preceded
by a double-leading-dash ("--"), this prefix can be removed when
an option is placed in a configuration file.
.TP
.B --help
Show options.
.TP
.B --config file
Load additional config options from
.B file
where each line corresponds to one command line option,
but with the leading '--' removed.

Double quotation characters ("") can be used
to enclose single parameters containing whitespace,
and "#" or ";" characters in the first column
can be used to denote comments.

Configuration files can be nested to a reasonable depth.

For examples of configuration files,
see
.I http://openvpn.sourceforge.net/examples.html

Here is an example configuration file:
.RS
.ft 3
.nf
.sp
#
# Sample OpenVPN configuration file for
# using a pre-shared static key.
#
# '#' or ';' may be used to delimit comments.

# Use a dynamic tun device.
dev tun

# Our remote peer
remote mypeer.mydomain

# 10.1.0.1 is our local VPN endpoint
# 10.1.0.2 is our remote VPN endpoint
ifconfig 10.1.0.1 10.1.0.2

# Our pre-shared static key
secret static.key

.SS Tunnel Options:
.TP
.B --local host
Local host name or IP address.
If specified, OpenVPN will bind to this address only.
If unspecified, OpenVPN will bind to all interfaces.
.TP
.B --remote host
Remote host name or IP address.  If unspecified, OpenVPN will listen
for packets from any IP address, but will not act on those packets unless
they pass all authentication tests.  This requirement for authentication
is binding on all potential peers, even those from known and supposedly
trusted IP addresses (it is very easy to forge a source IP address on
a UDP packet).

When used in TCP mode, 
.B --remote
will act as a filter, rejecting connections from any host which does
not match
.B host.
.TP
.B --proto p
Use protocol
.B p
for communicating with remote host.
.B p
can be
.B udp,
.B tcp-client,
or
.B tcp-server.

The default protocol is
.B udp
when
.B --proto
is not specified.

For UDP operation,
.B --proto udp
should be specified on both peers.

For TCP operation, one peer must use
.B --proto tcp-server
and the other must use
.B --proto tcp-client.
A peer started with
.B tcp-server
will wait indefinitely for an incoming connection.  A peer
started with
.B tcp-client
will attempt to connect, and if that fails, will sleep for 5
seconds and try again.  Both TCP client and server will simulate
a SIGUSR1 restart signal if either side resets the connection.

OpenVPN is designed to operate optimally over UDP, but TCP capability is provided
for situations where UDP cannot be used.
In comparison with UDP, TCP will usually be
somewhat less efficient and less robust when used over unreliable or congested
networks.  TCP support is also a newer addition to OpenVPN, added in version
1.5, and should still be considered experimental until 1.6 or 1.7.

This article outlines some of problems with tunneling IP over TCP:

.I http://sites.inka.de/sites/bigred/devel/tcp-tcp.html

There are certain cases, however, where using TCP may be advantageous from
a security and robustness perspective, such as tunneling non-IP or
application-level UDP protocols, or tunneling protocols which don't
possess a built-in reliability layer.
.TP
.B --connect-retry n
For
.B --proto tcp-client,
take
.B n
as the
number of seconds to wait
between connection retries (default=5).
.TP
.B --http-proxy server port [authfile]
Connect to remote host through an HTTP proxy at address
.B server
and port
.B port.
If HTTP Proxy-Authenticate is required,
.B authfile
is a file containing a username and password on 2 lines.
.TP
.B --http-proxy-retry
Retry indefinitely on HTTP proxy errors.  If an HTTP proxy error
occurs, simulate a SIGUSR1 reset.
.TP
.B --socks-proxy server [port]
Connect to remote host through a Socks5 proxy at address
.B server
and port
.B port
(default=1080).
.TP
.B --socks-proxy-retry
Retry indefinitely on Socks proxy errors.  If a Socks proxy error
occurs, simulate a SIGUSR1 reset.
.TP
.B --resolv-retry n
If hostname resolve fails for
.B --remote,
retry resolve for
.B n
seconds before failing (disabled by default).

Set
.B n
to "infinite" to retry indefinitely.
.TP
.B --float
Allow remote peer to change its IP address and/or port number, such as due to
DHCP (this is the default if
.B --remote
is not used).
.B --float
when specified with
.B --remote
allows an OpenVPN session to initially connect to a peer
at a known address, however if packets arrive from a new
address and pass all authentication tests, the new address
will take control of the session.  This is useful when
you are connecting to a peer which holds a dynamic address
such as a dial-in user or DHCP client.

Essentially,
.B --float
tells OpenVPN to accept authenticated packets
from any address, not only the address which was specified in the
.B --remote
option.
.TP
.B --ipchange cmd
Execute shell command
.B cmd
when our remote ip-address is initially authenticated or
changes.

Execute as:

.B cmd ip_address port_number

See the "Environmental Variables" section below for
additional parameters passed as environmental variables.

Note that
.B cmd
can be a shell command with multiple arguments, in which
case all OpenVPN-generated arguments will be appended
to
.B cmd
to build a command line which will be passed to the script.

If you are running in a dynamic IP address environment where
the IP addresses of either peer could change without notice,
you can use this script, for example, to edit the
.I /etc/hosts
file with the current address of the peer.  The script will
be run every time the remote peer changes its IP address.

Similarly if
.I our
IP address changes due to DHCP, we should configure
our IP address change script (see man page for
.BR dhcpcd (8)
) to deliver a
.B SIGHUP
or
.B SIGUSR1
signal to OpenVPN.  OpenVPN will then
reestablish a connection with its most recently authenticated
peer on its new IP address.
.TP
.B --port port
TCP/UDP port number for both local and remote.
.TP
.B --lport port
TCP/UDP port number for local (default=5000).
.TP
.B --rport port
TCP/UDP port number for remote (default=5000).
.TP
.B --nobind
Do not bind to local address and port.  The IP stack will allocate
a dynamic port for returning packets.  Since the value of the dynamic port
could not be known in advance by a peer, this option is only suitable for
peers which will be initiating connections by using the
.B --remote
option.
.TP
.B --dev tunX | tapX | null
TUN/TAP virtual network device (
.B X
can be omitted for a dynamic device.)

See examples section below
for an example on setting up a TUN device.

You must use either tun devices on both ends of the connection
or tap devices on both ends.  You cannot mix them, as they
represent different underlying protocols.

.B tun
devices encapsulate IPv4 while
.B tap
devices encapsulate ethernet 802.3.
.TP
.B --dev-type device-type
Which device type are we using?
.B device-type
should be
.B tun
or
.B tap.
Use this option only if the TUN/TAP device used with
.B --dev
does not begin with
.B tun
or
.B tap.
.TP
.B --tun-ipv6
Build a tun link capable of forwarding IPv6 traffic.
Should be used in conjunction with
.B --dev tun
or
.B --dev tunX.
A warning will be displayed
if no specific IPv6 TUN support for your OS has been compiled into OpenVPN.
.TP
.B --dev-node node
Explicitly set the device node rather than using
/dev/net/tun, /dev/tun, /dev/tap, etc.  If OpenVPN
cannot figure out whether
.B node
is a TUN or TAP device based on the name, you should
also specify
.B --dev-type tun
or
.B --dev-type tap.

On Windows systems, select the TAP-Win32 adapter which
is named
.B node
in the Network Control Panel.  The
.B --show-adapters
option under Windows can also be used
to enumerate all available TAP-Win32
adapters.
.TP
.B --ifconfig l rn
Set TUN/TAP adapter parameters. 
.B l
is the IP address of the local VPN endpoint.
For TUN devices,
.B rn
is the IP address of the remote VPN endpoint.
For TAP devices,
.B rn
is the subnet mask of the virtual ethernet segment
which is being created or connected to.

For TUN devices, which facilitate virtual
point-to-point IP connections,
the proper usage of
.B --ifconfig
is to use two private IP addresses
which are not a member of any
existing subnet which is in use.
The IP addresses may be consecutive
and should have their order reversed
on the remote peer.  After the VPN
is established, by pinging
.B rn,
you will be pinging across the VPN.

For TAP devices, which provide
the ability to create virtual
ethernet segments,
.B --ifconfig
is used to set an IP address and
subnet mask just as a physical
ethernet adapter would be
similarly configured.  If you are
attempting to connect to a remote
ethernet bridge, the IP address
and subnet should be set to values
which would be valid on the
the bridged ethernet segment (note
also that DHCP can be used for the
same purpose).

This option, while primarily a proxy for the
.BR ifconfig (8)
command, is designed to simplify TUN/TAP
tunnel configuration by providing a
standard interface to the different
ifconfig implementations on different
platforms.

.B --ifconfig
parameters which are IP addresses can
also be specified as a DNS or /etc/hosts
file resolvable name.

For TAP devices,
.B --ifconfig
should not be used if the TAP interface will be
getting an IP address lease from a DHCP
server.
.TP
.B --ifconfig-noexec
Don't actually execute ifconfig/netsh commands, instead
pass
.B --ifconfig
parameters to scripts using environmental variables.
.TP
.B --ifconfig-nowarn
Don't output an options consistency check warning
if the
.B --ifconfig
option on this side of the
connection doesn't match the remote side.  This is useful
when you want to retain the overall benefits of the
options consistency check (also see
.B --disable-occ
option) while only disabling the ifconfig component of
the check.

For example,
if you have a configuration where the local host uses
.B --ifconfig
but the remote host does not, use
.B --ifconfig-nowarn
on the local host.
.TP
.B --route network [netmask] [gateway] [metric]
Add route to routing table after connection is established.
Multiple routes can be specified.  Routes will be
automatically torn down in reverse order prior to
tun/tap device close.

This option is intended as
a convenience proxy for the
.BR route (8)
shell command,
while at the same time providing portable semantics
across OpenVPN's platform space.

.B netmask
default -- 255.255.255.255

.B gateway
default -- taken from
.B --route-gateway
or the second parameter to
.B --ifconfig
when
.B --dev tun
is specified.

The default can be specified by leaving an option blank or setting
it to "default".

The
.B network
and
.B gateway
parameters can
also be specified as a DNS or /etc/hosts
file resolvable name, or as one of three special keywords:

.B vpn_gateway
-- The remote VPN endpoint address
(derived either from
.B --route-gateway
or the second parameter to
.B --ifconfig
when
.B --dev tun
is specified).

.B net_gateway
-- The pre-existing IP default gateway, read from the routing
table (Linux and Windows only).

.B remote_host
-- The
.B --remote
address, or the address of a connecting client if OpenVPN
is being run in server mode.
.TP
.B --route-gateway gw
Specify a default gateway
.B gw
for use with
.B --route.
.TP
.B --route-delay [n]
Delay
.B n
seconds (default=0) after connection
establishment, before adding routes. If
.B n
is 0, routes will be added immediately upon connection
establishment.  If
.B --route-delay
is omitted, routes will be added immediately after tun/tap device
open and
.B --up
script execution, before any
.B --user
or 
.B --group
privilege downgrade (or
.B --chroot
execution.)

This option is designed to be useful in scenarios where DHCP is
used to set
tap adapter addresses.  The delay will give the DHCP handshake
time to complete before routes are added.

A better solution would be to poll the virtual adapter, waiting
for its IP address to become defined, but unfortunately there
is no platform independent mechanism for doing this.
.TP
.B --route-up cmd
Execute shell command
.B cmd
after routes are added, subject to
.B --route-delay.

See the "Environmental Variables" section below for
additional parameters passed as environmental variables.

Note that
.B cmd
can be a shell command with multiple arguments.
.TP
.B --route-noexec
Don't add or remove routes automatically.  Instead pass routes to
.B --route-up
script using environmental variables.
.TP
.B --redirect-gateway
(Experimental) Automatically execute routing commands to cause all outgoing IP traffic
to be redirected over the VPN.  Currently implemented only on Linux and Windows.

This option performs three steps:

.B (1)
Create a static route for the
.B --remote
address which forwards to the pre-existing default gateway.
This is done so that
.B (3)
will not create a routing loop.

.B (2)
Delete the default gateway route.

.B (3)
Set the new default gateway to be the VPN endpoint address (derived either from
.B --route-gateway
or the second parameter to
.B --ifconfig
when
.B --dev tun
is specified).

When the tunnel is torn down, all of the above steps are reversed so
that the original default route is restored.
.TP
.B --link-mtu n
Take the link device MTU to be n and derive the TUN MTU
from it (default=1300 for TUN devices).  The
default is a conservative
value that was chosen
because it has a higher probability of working correctly.
However, for many
cases, using a value of 1472 will maximize performance for TUN devices
over IPv4.

Fundamentally,
.B --link-mtu
sets an upper bound on the size of UDP packets which are sent
between OpenVPN peers.

Prior to OpenVPN 1.5, this option was named
.B --udp-mtu.
While deprecated, this name will still be supported
for compatibility.

The MTU (Maximum Transmission Units) is
the maximum datagram size in bytes that can be sent unfragmented
over a particular network path.  OpenVPN requires that packets
on the control or data channels be sent unfragmented.

Typically, the link MTU should be set to a value between 1300 and 1500.
The optimal size for link MTU is the largest
MTU that can be handled by every router on the link path.
The link MTU value should be equal on both peers.

MTU problems often manifest themselves as connections which
hang during periods of active usage.  The
.B --fragment
and
.B --mssfix
options are provided as workarounds to such problems.
When using either of these options, it's best to
set
.B --tun-mtu
to 1500.

OpenVPN
adds a small amount of overhead to each tunnel packet before
it is forwarded from the TUN device over the secure link channel.
This overhead consists of data fields such as the HMAC signature,
packet ID, encryption block padding, etc.  Because of this overhead,
the TUN device MTU should be slightly smaller than the link device
MTU to make room for the extra bytes which OpenVPN adds to every
data channel packet.  OpenVPN allows you to explicitly specify either
the TUN MTU or the link MTU (but not both).  OpenVPN will then
compute the value you didn't specify based on the value you did.
OpenVPN will compute exactly how much overhead it will need to add
to each packet, based on the other options you specify.  If you
specify an
.B --up
script, OpenVPN will pass the TUN MTU and link MTU values on the command line
to the script.
.TP
.B --tun-mtu n
Take the TUN device MTU to be
.B n
and derive the link MTU
from it (default=1500 for TAP devices).

See
.B --link-mtu
above more more information on MTU.
.TP
.B --tun-mtu-extra n
Assume that the TUN/TAP device might return as many as
.B n
bytes more than the
.B --tun-mtu
size on read.  This parameter defaults to 0, which is sufficient for
most TUN devices.  TAP devices may introduce additional overhead in excess
of the MTU size, and a setting of 32 is the default when TAP devices are used.
This parameter only controls internal OpenVPN buffer sizing,
so there is no transmission overhead associated with using a larger value.
.TP
.B --mtu-disc type
Should we do Path MTU discovery on TCP/UDP channel?  Only supported on OSes such
as Linux that supports the necessary system call to set.

.B 'no'
-- Never send DF (Don't Fragment) frames
.br
.B 'maybe'
-- Use per-route hints
.br
.B 'yes'
-- Always DF (Don't Fragment)
.br
.TP
.B --mtu-test
To empirically measure MTU on connection startup,
add the
.B --mtu-test
option to your configuration.
OpenVPN will send ping packets of various sizes
to the remote peer and measure the largest packets
which were successfully received.  The
.B --mtu-test
process normally takes about 3 minutes to complete.
.TP
.B --fragment max
Enable internal datagram fragmentation so
that no UDP datagrams are sent which
are larger than
.B max
bytes.

The
.B max
parameter is interpreted in the same way as the
.B --link-mtu
parameter, i.e. the UDP packet size after encapsulation
overhead has been added in, but not including
the UDP header itself.

The
.B --fragment
option only makes sense when you are using the UDP protocol
for OpenVPN peer-to-peer communication, i.e.
.B --proto udp.

.B --fragment
adds 4 bytes of overhead per datagram.

See the
.B --mssfix
option below for an important companion option to
.B --fragment.

It should also be noted that this option is not meant to replace
UDP fragmentation at the IP stack level.  It is only meant as a
last resort when path MTU discovery is broken.  Using this option
is less efficient than fixing path MTU discovery for your IP link and
using native IP fragmentation instead.

Having said that, there are circumstances where using OpenVPN's
internal fragmentation capability may be your only option, such
as tunneling a UDP multicast stream which requires fragmentation.
.TP
.B --mssfix max
Announce to TCP sessions running over the tunnel that they should limit
their send packet sizes such that after OpenVPN has encapsulated them,
the resulting UDP packet size that OpenVPN sends to its peer will not
exceed
.B max
bytes.

The
.B max
parameter is interpreted in the same way as the
.B --link-mtu
parameter, i.e. the UDP packet size after encapsulation
overhead has been added in, but not including
the UDP header itself.

The
.B --mssfix
option only makes sense when you are using the UDP protocol
for OpenVPN peer-to-peer communication, i.e.
.B --proto udp.

.B --mssfix
and
.B --fragment
can be ideally used together, where
.B --mssfix
will try to keep TCP from needing
packet fragmentation in the first place,
and if big packets come through anyhow
(from protocols other than TCP),
.B --fragment
will internally fragment them.

Both
.B --fragment
and
.B --mssfix
are designed to work around cases where Path MTU discovery
is broken on the network path between OpenVPN peers.

The usual symptom of such a breakdown is an OpenVPN
connection which successfully starts, but then stalls
during active usage.

If
.B --fragment
and
.B --mssfix
are used together,
.B --mssfix
will take its default
.B max
parameter from the
.B --fragment max
option.

Therefore, one could lower the maximum UDP packet size
to 1300 (a good first try for solving MTU-related
connection problems) with the following options:

.B --tun-mtu 1500 --fragment 1300 --mssfix
.TP
.B --shaper n
Limit bandwidth of outgoing tunnel data to
.B n
bytes per second on the TCP/UDP port.
If you want to limit the bandwidth
in both directions, use this option on both peers.

OpenVPN uses the following algorithm to implement
traffic shaping: Given a shaper rate of
.I n
bytes per second, after a datagram write of
.I b
bytes is queued on the TCP/UDP port, wait a minimum of
.I (b / n)
seconds before queuing the next write.

It should be noted that OpenVPN supports multiple
tunnels between the same two peers, allowing you
to construct full-speed and reduced bandwidth tunnels
at the same time,
routing low-priority data such as off-site backups
over the reduced bandwidth tunnel, and other data
over the full-speed tunnel.

Also note that for low bandwidth tunnels
(under 1000 bytes per second), you should probably
use lower MTU values as well (see above), otherwise
the packet latency will grow so large as to trigger
timeouts in the TLS layer and TCP connections running
over the tunnel.

OpenVPN allows
.B n
to be between 100 bytes/sec and 100 Mbytes/sec.
.TP
.B --inactive n
Causes OpenVPN to exit after
.B n
seconds of inactivity on the TUN/TAP device.  The time length
of inactivity is measured since the last incoming tunnel packet.
.TP
.B --ping n
Ping remote over the TCP/UDP control channel
if no packets have been sent for at least
.B n
seconds (specify
.B --ping
on both peers to cause ping packets to be sent in both directions since
OpenVPN ping packets are not echoed like IP ping packets).
When used in one of OpenVPN's secure modes (where
.B --secret, --tls-server,
or
.B --tls-client
is specified), the ping packet
will be cryptographically secure.

This option has two intended uses:

(1) Compatibility
with stateful firewalls.  The periodic ping will ensure that
a stateful firewall rule which allows OpenVPN UDP packets to
pass will not time out.

(2) To provide a basis for the remote to test the existence
of its peer using the
.B --ping-exit
option.
.TP
.B --ping-exit n
Causes OpenVPN to exit after
.B n
seconds pass without reception of a ping
or other packet from remote.
This option can be combined with
.B --inactive, --ping,
and
.B --ping-exit
to create a two-tiered inactivity disconnect.

For example,

.B openvpn [options...] --inactive 3600 --ping 10 --ping-exit 60

when used on both peers will cause OpenVPN to exit within 60
seconds if its peer disconnects, but will exit after one
hour if no actual tunnel data is exchanged.
.TP
.B --ping-restart n
Similar to
.B --ping-exit,
but trigger a
.B SIGUSR1
restart after
.B n
seconds pass without reception of a ping
or other packet from remote.

This option is useful in cases
where the remote peer has a dynamic IP address and
a low-TTL DNS name is used to track the IP address using
a service such as
.I http://dyndns.org/
+ a dynamic DNS client such
as
.B ddclient.

If the peer cannot be reached, a restart will be triggered, causing
the hostname used with
.B --remote
to be re-resolved (if
.B --resolv-retry
is also specified).

See the signals section below for more information
on
.B SIGUSR1.

Note that the behavior of
.B SIGUSR1
can be modified by the
.B --persist-tun, --persist-key, --persist-local-ip,
and
.B --persist-remote-ip
options.

Also note that
.B --ping-exit
and
.B --ping-restart
are mutually exclusive and cannot be used together.
.TP
.B --ping-timer-rem
Run the
.B --ping-exit
/
.B --ping-restart
timer only if we have a remote address.  Use this option if you are
starting the daemon in listen mode (i.e. without an explicit
.B --remote
peer), and you don't want to start clocking timeouts until a remote
peer connects.
.TP
.B --persist-tun
Don't close and reopen TUN/TAP device or run up/down scripts
across
.B SIGUSR1
or
.B --ping-restart
restarts.

.B SIGUSR1
is a restart signal similar to
.B SIGHUP,
but which offers finer-grained control over
reset options.
.TP
.B --persist-key
Don't re-read key files across
.B SIGUSR1
or
.B --ping-restart.

This option can be combined with
.B --user nobody
to allow restarts triggered by the
.B SIGUSR1
signal.
Normally if you drop root privileges in OpenVPN,
the daemon cannot be restarted since it will now be unable to re-read protected
key files.

This option solves the problem by persisting keys across
.B SIGUSR1
resets, so they don't need to be re-read.
.TP
.B --persist-local-ip
Preserve initially resolved local IP address and port number
across
.B SIGUSR1
or
.B --ping-restart
restarts.
.TP
.B --persist-remote-ip
Preserve most recently authenticated remote IP address and port number
across
.B SIGUSR1
or
.B --ping-restart
restarts.
.TP
.B --mlock
Disable paging by calling the POSIX mlockall function.
Requires that OpenVPN be initially run as root (though
OpenVPN can subsequently downgrade its UID using the
.B --user
option).

Using this option ensures that key material and tunnel
data are never written to disk due to virtual
memory paging operations which occur under most
modern operating systems.  It ensures that even if an
attacker was able to crack the box running OpenVPN, he
would not be able to scan the system swap file to
recover previously used
ephemeral keys, which are used for a period of time
governed by the
.B --reneg
options (see below), then are discarded.

The downside
of using
.B --mlock
is that it will reduce the amount of physical
memory available to other applications.
.TP
.B --up cmd
Shell command to run after successful TUN/TAP device open
(pre
.B --user
UID change).  The up script is useful for specifying route
commands which route IP traffic destined for
private subnets which exist at the other
end of the VPN connection into the tunnel.

For
.B --dev tun
execute as:

.B cmd tun_dev tun_mtu link_mtu ifconfig_local_ip ifconfig_remote_ip [ init | restart ]

For
.B --dev tap
execute as:

.B cmd tap_dev tap_mtu link_mtu ifconfig_local_ip ifconfig_netmask [ init | restart ]

See the "Environmental Variables" section below for
additional parameters passed as environmental variables.

Note that
.B cmd
can be a shell command with multiple arguments, in which
case all OpenVPN-generated arguments will be appended
to
.B cmd
to build a command line which will be passed to the shell.

Typically,
.B cmd
will run a script to add routes to the tunnel.

Normally the up script is called after the TUN/TAP device is opened.
In this context, the last command line parameter passed to the script
will be
.I init.
If the
.B --up-restart
option is also used, the up script will be called for restarts as
well.  A restart is considered to be a partial reinitialization
of OpenVPN where the TUN/TAP instance is preserved (the
.B --persist-tun
option will enable such preservation).  A restart
can be generated by a SIGUSR1 signal, a
.B --ping-restart
timeout, or a connection reset when the TCP protocol is enabled
with the
.B --proto
option.  If a restart occurs, and
.B --up-restart
has been specified, the up script will be called with
.I restart
as the last parameter.

The following standalone example shows how the
.B --up
script can be called in both an initialization and restart context.
(NOTE: for security reasons, don't run the following example unless UDP port
9999 is blocked by your firewall.  Also, the example will run indefinitely,
so you should abort with control-c).

.B openvpn --dev tun --port 9999 --verb 4 --ping-restart 10 --up 'echo up' --down 'echo down' --persist-tun --up-restart

Note that OpenVPN also provides the
.B --ifconfig
option to automatically ifconfig the TUN device,
eliminating the need to define an
.B --up
script, unless you also want to configure routes
in the
.B --up
script.

If
.B --ifconfig
is also specified, OpenVPN will pass the ifconfig local
and remote endpoints on the command line to the
.B --up
script so that they can be used to configure routes such as:

.B route add -net 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw $5
.TP
.B --up-delay
Delay TUN/TAP open and possible
.B --up
script execution
until after TCP/UDP connection establishment with peer.

In
.B --proto udp
mode, this option normally requires the use of
.B --ping
to allow connection initiation to be sensed in the absence
of tunnel data, since UDP is a "connectionless" protocol.

On Windows, this option will delay the TAP-Win32 media state
transitioning to "connected" until connection establishment,
i.e. the receipt of the first authenticated packet from the peer.
.TP
.B --down cmd
Shell command to run after TUN/TAP device close
(post
.B --user
UID change and/or
.B --chroot
).  Called with the same parameters and environmental
variables as the
.B --up
option above.
.TP
.B --up-restart
Enable the
.B --up
and
.B --down
scripts to be called for restarts as well as initial program start.
This option is described more fully above in the
.B --up
option documentation.
.TP
.B --setenv name value
Set a custom environmental variable
.B name=value
to pass to script.
.TP
.B --disable-occ
Don't output a warning message if option inconsistencies are detected between
peers.  An example of an option inconsistency would be where one peer uses
.B --dev tun
while the other peer uses
.B --dev tap.

Use of this option is discouraged, but is provided as
a temporary fix in situations where a recent version of OpenVPN must
connect to an old version.
.TP
.B --user user
Change the user ID of the OpenVPN process to
.B user
after initialization, dropping privileges in the process.
This option is useful to protect the system
in the event that some hostile party was able to gain control of
an OpenVPN session.  Though OpenVPN's security features make
this unlikely, it is provided as a second line of defense.

By setting
.B user
to
.I nobody
or somebody similarly unprivileged, the hostile party would be
limited in what damage they could cause.  Of course once
you take away privileges, you cannot return them
to an OpenVPN session.  This means, for example, that if
you want to reset an OpenVPN daemon with a
.B SIGUSR1
signal
(for example in response
to a DHCP reset), you should make use of one or more of the
.B --persist
options to ensure that OpenVPN doesn't need to execute any privileged
operations in order to restart (such as re-reading key files
or running
.BR ifconfig
on the TUN device).
.TP
.B --group group
Similar to the
.B --user
option,
this option changes the group ID of the OpenVPN process to
.B group
after initialization.
.TP
.B --cd dir
Change directory to
.B dir
prior to reading any files such as
configuration files, key files, scripts, etc.
.B dir
should be an absolute path, with a leading "/",
and without any references
to the current directory such as "." or "..".

This option is useful when you are running
OpenVPN in 
.B --daemon
mode, and you want to consolidate all of
your OpenVPN control files in one location.
.TP
.B --chroot dir
Chroot to
.B dir
after initialization.  
.B --chroot
essentially redefines
.B dir
as being the top
level directory tree (/).  OpenVPN will therefore
be unable to access any files outside this tree.
This can be desirable from a security standpoint.

Since the chroot operation is delayed until after
initialization, most OpenVPN options that reference
files will operate in a pre-chroot context.

In many cases, the
.B dir
parameter can point to an empty directory, however
complications can result when scripts or restarts
are executed after the chroot operation.
.TP
.B --daemon [progname]
Become a daemon after all initialization functions are completed.
This option will cause all message and error output to
be sent to the syslog file (such as /var/log/messages),
except for the output of shell scripts and
ifconfig commands,
which will go to /dev/null unless otherwise redirected.
The syslog redirection occurs immediately at the point
that
.B --daemon
is parsed on the command line even though
the daemonization point occurs later.  If one of the
.B --log
options is present, it will supercede syslog
redirection.

The optional
.B progname
parameter will cause OpenVPN to report its program name
to the system logger as
.B progname.
This can be useful in linking OpenVPN messages
in the syslog file with specific tunnels.
When unspecified,
.B progname
defaults to "openvpn".

When OpenVPN is run with the
.B --daemon
option, it will try to delay daemonization until the majority of initialization
functions which are capable of generating fatal errors are complete.  This means
that initialization scripts can test the return status of the
openvpn command for a fairly reliable indication of whether the command
has correctly initialized and entered the packet forwarding event loop.

In OpenVPN, the vast majority of errors which occur after initialization are non-fatal.
.TP
.B --passtos
Set the TOS field of the tunnel packet to what the payload's TOS is.
.TP
.B --inetd [wait|nowait] [progname]
Use this option when OpenVPN is being run from the inetd or
.BR xinetd(8)
server.

The
.B wait/nowait
option must match what is specified in the inetd/xinetd
config file.  The
.B nowait
mode can only be used with
.B --proto tcp-server.
The default is
.B wait.
The
.B nowait
mode can be used to instantiate the OpenVPN daemon as a classic TCP server,
where client connection requests are serviced on a single
port number.  For additional information on this kind of configuration,
see the OpenVPN FAQ:
.I http://openvpn.sourceforge.net/faq.html#oneport

This option precludes the use of
.B --daemon, --local,
or
.B --remote.
Note that this option causes message and error output to be handled in the same
way as the
.B --daemon
option.  The optional
.B progname
parameter is also handled exactly as in
.B --daemon.

Also note that in
.B wait
mode, each OpenVPN tunnel requires a separate TCP/UDP port and
a separate inetd or xinetd entry.  See the OpenVPN HOWTO for an example
on using OpenVPN with xinetd:
.I http://openvpn.sourceforge.net/howto.html
.TP
.B --log file
Output logging messages to
.B file,
including output to stdout/stderr which
is generated by called scripts.
If
.B file
already exists it will be truncated.
This option takes effect
immediately when it is parsed in the command line
and will supercede syslog output if
.B --daemon
or
.B --inetd
is also specified.
This option is persistent over the entire course of
an OpenVPN instantiation and will not be reset by SIGHUP,
SIGUSR1, or
.B --ping-restart.
.TP
.B --log-append file
Append logging messages to
.B file.
If
.B file
does not exist, it will be created.
This option behaves exactly like
.B --log
except that it appends to rather
than truncating the log file.
.TP
.B --writepid file
Write OpenVPN's main process ID to
.B file.
.TP
.B --nice n
Change process priority after initialization
(
.B n
greater than 0 is lower priority,
.B n
less than zero is higher priority).
.TP
.B --nice-work n
Change priority of background TLS work thread.  The TLS thread
feature is enabled when OpenVPN is built
with pthread support, and you are running OpenVPN
in TLS mode (i.e. with
.B --tls-client
or
.B --tls-server
specified).

Using a TLS thread offloads the CPU-intensive process of SSL/TLS-based
key exchange to a background thread so that it does not become
a latency bottleneck in the tunnel packet forwarding process.

The parameter
.B n
is interpreted exactly as with the
.B --nice
option above, but in relation to the work thread rather
than the main thread.
.TP
.B --verb n
Set output verbosity to
.B n
(default=1).  Each level shows all info from the previous levels.
Level 3 is recommended if you want a good summary
of what's happening without being swamped by output.

.B 0 --
No output except fatal errors.
.br
.B 1 --
Show startup information + connection initiated messages + non-fatal encryption & net errors.
.br
.B 2 --
Show SSL/TLS negotiations.
.br
.B 3 --
Show extra SSL/TLS info +
.B --gremlin
net outages + adaptive compression state changes (on or off).
.br
.B 4 --
Show all parameter settings.
.br
.B 5 --
Output
.B R
and
.B W
characters to the console for each packet read and write, uppercase is
used for TCP/UDP packets and lowercase is used for TUN/TAP packets.
.br
.B 6 to 11 --
Show debug info of increasing verbosity (see errlevel.h for additional
information on debug levels).
.TP
.B --mute n
Log at most
.B n
consecutive messages in the same category.  This is useful to
limit repetitive logging of similar message types.
.TP
.B --gremlin
Simulate dropped & corrupted packets + network outages
(for debugging and testing only).  This is a
powerful tool for verifying the robustness of the OpenVPN protocol,
especially in TLS mode.  When used with TLS parameters that force
frequent key renegotiations such as
.B --reneg-sec 10,
this option will stress-test the ability of OpenVPN peers to recover
from errors and remain in sync.
Current parameter settings will cause
.B --gremlin
to drop 2% of packets and corrupt another 2%.  A packet corruption will
alter a random byte in the packet to a random value.  It might
also increase or decrease the size of the packet by one byte.
.B --gremlin
will also simulate network outages by going "down"
for a period of 10 to 60 seconds.
Between simulated outages, OpenVPN will
remain up for periods of 10 to 300 seconds.  To see gremlin
messages, set
.B --verb
to 3 or higher.  To change gremlin constants, consult the
file gremlin.c included in the OpenVPN source distribution.
.TP
.B --comp-lzo
Use fast LZO compression -- may add up to 1 byte per
packet for incompressible data.
.TP
.B --comp-noadapt
When used in conjunction with
.B --comp-lzo,
this option will disable OpenVPN's adaptive compression algorithm.
Normally, adaptive compression is enabled with
.B --comp-lzo.

Adaptive compression tries to optimize the case where you have
compression enabled, but you are sending predominantly uncompressible
(or pre-compressed) packets over the tunnel, such as an FTP or rsync transfer
of a large, compressed file.  With adaptive compression,
OpenVPN will periodically sample the compression process to measure its
efficiency.  If the data being sent over the tunnel is already compressed,
the compression efficiency will be very low, triggering openvpn to disable
compression for a period of time until the next re-sample test.
.B 
.SS Data Channel Encryption Options:
These options are meaningful for both Static & TLS-negotiated key modes
(must be compatible between peers).
.TP
.B --secret file [direction]
Enable Static Key encryption mode (non-TLS).
Use pre-shared secret
.B file
which was generated with
.B --genkey.

The optional
.B direction
parameter enables the use of 4 distinct keys
(HMAC-send, cipher-encrypt, HMAC-receive, cipher-decrypt), so that
each data flow direction has a different set of HMAC and cipher keys.
This has a number of desirable security properties including
eliminating certain kinds of DoS and message replay attacks.

When the
.B direction
parameter is omitted, 2 keys are used bidirectionally, one for HMAC
and the other for encryption/decryption.

The
.B direction
parameter should always be complementary on either side of the connection,
i.e. one side should use "0" and the other should use "1", or both sides
should omit it altogether.

The
.B direction
parameter requires that
.B file
contains a 2048 bit key.  While pre-1.5 versions of OpenVPN
generate 1024 bit key files, any version of OpenVPN which
supports the
.B direction
parameter, will also support 2048 bit key file generation
using the
.B --genkey
option.

Static key encryption mode has certain advantages,
the primary being ease of configuration.

There are no certificates
or certificate authorities or complicated negotiation handshakes and protocols.
The only requirement is that you have a pre-existing secure channel with
your peer (such as
.B ssh
) to initially copy the key.  This requirement, along with the
fact that your key never changes unless you manually generate a new one,
makes it somewhat less secure than TLS mode (see below).  If an attacker
manages to steal your key, everything that was ever encrypted with
it is compromised.  Contrast that to the perfect forward secrecy features of
TLS mode (using Diffie Hellman key exchange), where even if an attacker
was able to steal your private key, he would gain no information to help
him decrypt past sessions.

Another advantageous aspect of Static Key encryption mode is that
it is a handshake-free protocol 
without any distinguishing signature or feature
(such as a header or protocol handshake sequence) 
that would mark the ciphertext packets as being
generated by OpenVPN.  Anyone eavesdropping on the wire
would see nothing
but random-looking data.
.TP
.B --auth alg
Authenticate packets with HMAC using message
digest algorithm
.B alg.
(The default is
.B SHA1
).
HMAC is a commonly used message authentication algorithm (MAC) that uses
a data string, a secure hash algorithm, and a key, to produce
a digital signature.

OpenVPN's usage of HMAC is to first encrypt a packet, then HMAC the resulting ciphertext.

In static-key encryption mode, the HMAC key
is included in the key file generated by
.B --genkey.
In TLS mode, the HMAC key is dynamically generated and shared
between peers via the TLS control channel.  If OpenVPN receives a packet with
a bad HMAC it will drop the packet.
HMAC usually adds 16 or 20 bytes per packet.
Set
.B alg=none
to disable authentication.

For more information on HMAC see
.I http://www.cs.ucsd.edu/users/mihir/papers/hmac.html
.TP
.B --cipher alg
Encrypt packets with cipher algorithm
.B alg.
The default is
.B BF-CBC,
an abbreviation for Blowfish in Cipher Block Chaining mode.
Blowfish has the advantages of being fast, very secure, and allowing key sizes
of up to 448 bits.  Blowfish is designed to be used in situations where
keys are changed infrequently.

For more information on blowfish, see
.I http://www.counterpane.com/blowfish.html

To see other ciphers that are available with
OpenVPN, use the
.B --show-ciphers
option.

OpenVPN supports the CBC, CFB, and OFB cipher modes.

Set
.B alg=none
to disable encryption.
.TP
.B --keysize n
Size of cipher key in bits (optional).
If unspecified, defaults to cipher-specific default.  The
.B --show-ciphers
option (see below) shows all available OpenSSL ciphers,
their default key sizes, and whether the key size can
be changed.  Use care in changing a cipher's default
key size.  Many ciphers have not been extensively
cryptanalyzed with non-standard key lengths, and a
larger key may offer no real guarantee of greater
security, or may even reduce security.
.TP
.B --no-replay
Disable OpenVPN's protection against replay attacks.
Don't use this option unless you are prepared to make
a tradeoff of greater efficiency in exchange for less
security.

OpenVPN provides datagram replay protection by default.

Replay protection is accomplished
by tagging each outgoing datagram with an identifier
that is guaranteed to be unique for the key being used.
The peer that receives the datagram will check for
the uniqueness of the identifier.  If the identifier
was already received in a previous datagram, OpenVPN
will drop the packet.  Replay protection is important
to defeat attacks such as a SYN flood attack, where
the attacker listens in the wire, intercepts a TCP
SYN packet (identifying it by the context in which
it occurs in relation to other packets), then floods
the receiving peer with copies of this packet.

OpenVPN's replay protection is implemented in slightly
different ways, depending on the key management mode
you have selected.

In Static Key mode
or when using an CFB or OFB mode cipher, OpenVPN uses a
64 bit unique identifier that combines a time stamp with
an incrementing sequence number.

When using TLS mode for key exchange and a CBC cipher
mode, OpenVPN uses only a 32 bit sequence number without
a time stamp, since OpenVPN can guarantee the uniqueness
of this value for each key.  As in IPSec, if the sequence number is
close to wrapping back to zero, OpenVPN will trigger
a new key exchange.

To check for replays, OpenVPN uses
the
.I sliding window
algorithm used
by IPSec.
.TP
.B --replay-window n [t]
Use a replay protection sliding-window of size
.B n
and a time window of
.B t
seconds.

By default
.B n
is 64 (the IPSec default) and
.B t
is 15 seconds.

This option is only relevant in UDP mode, i.e.
when either
.B --proto udp
is specifed, or no
.B --proto
option is specified.

When OpenVPN tunnels IP packets over UDP, there is the possibility that
packets might be dropped or delivered out of order.  Because OpenVPN, like IPSec,
is emulating the physical network layer,
it will accept an out-of-order packet sequence, and
will deliver such packets in the same order they were received to
the TCP/IP protocol stack, provided they satisfy several constraints.

.B (a)
The packet cannot be a replay (unless
.B --no-replay
is specified, which disables replay protection altogether).

.B (b)
If a packet arrives out of order, it will only be accepted if the difference
between its sequence number and the highest sequence number received
so far is less than
.B n.

.B (c)
If a packet arrives out of order, it will only be accepted if it arrives no later
than
.B t
seconds after any packet containing a higher sequence number.

If you are using a network link with a large pipeline (meaning that
the product of bandwidth and latency is high), you may want to use
a larger value for
.B n.
Satellite links in particular often require this.

If you run OpenVPN at
.B --verb 4,
you will see the message "Replay-window backtrack occurred [x]"
every time the maximum sequence number backtrack seen thus far
increases.  This can be used to calibrate
.B n.

There is some controversy on the appropriate method of handling packet
reordering at the security layer.

Namely, to what extent should the
security layer protect the encapsulated protocol from attacks which masquerade
as the kinds of normal packet loss and reordering that occur over IP networks?

The IPSec and OpenVPN approach is to allow packet reordering within a certain
fixed sequence number window.

OpenVPN adds to the IPSec model by limiting the window size in time as well as
sequence space.

OpenVPN also adds TCP transport as an option (not offered by IPSec) in which
case OpenVPN can adopt a very strict attitude towards message deletion and
reordering:  Don't allow it.  Since TCP guarantees reliability, any packet
loss or reordering event can be assumed to be an attack.

In this sense, it could be argued that TCP tunnel transport is preferred when
tunneling non-IP or UDP application protocols which might be vulnerable to a
message deletion or reordering attack which falls within the normal
operational parameters of IP networks.

So I would make the statement that one should never tunnel a non-IP protocol
or UDP application protocol over UDP, if the protocol might be vulnerable to a
message deletion or reordering attack that falls within the normal operating
parameters of what is to be expected from the physical IP layer.  The problem
is easily fixed by simply using TCP as the VPN transport layer.
.TP
.B --replay-persist file
Persist replay-protection state across sessions using
.B file
to save and reload the state.

This option will strengthen protection against replay attacks,
especially when you are using OpenVPN in a dynamic context (such
as with
.B --inetd)
when OpenVPN sessions are frequently started and stopped. 

This option will keep a disk copy of the current replay protection
state (i.e. the most recent packet timestamp and sequence number
received from the remote peer), so that if an OpenVPN session
is stopped and restarted, it will reject any replays of packets
which were already received by the prior session.

This option only makes sense when replay protection is enabled
(the default) and you are using either
.B --secret
(shared-secret key mode) or TLS mode with
.B --tls-auth.
.TP
.B --no-iv
Disable OpenVPN's use of IV (cipher initialization vector).
Don't use this option unless you are prepared to make
a tradeoff of greater efficiency in exchange for less
security.

OpenVPN uses an IV by default, and requires it for CFB and
OFB cipher modes (which are totally insecure without it).
Using an IV is important for security when multiple
messages are being encrypted/decrypted with the same key.

IV is implemented differently depending on the cipher mode used.

In CBC mode, OpenVPN uses a pseudo-random IV for each packet.

In CFB/OFB mode, OpenVPN uses a unique sequence number and time stamp
as the IV.  In fact, in CFB/OFB mode, OpenVPN uses a datagram
space-saving optimization that uses the unique identifier for
datagram replay protection as the IV.
.TP
.B --test-crypto
Do a self-test of OpenVPN's crypto options by encrypting and
decrypting test packets using the data channel encryption options
specified above.  This option does not require a peer to function,
and therefore can be specified without
.B --dev
or
.B --remote.

The typical usage of
.B --test-crypto
would be something like this:

.B openvpn --test-crypto --secret key

or

.B openvpn --test-crypto --secret key --verb 9

This option is very useful to test OpenVPN after it has been ported to
a new platform, or to isolate problems in the compiler, OpenSSL
crypto library, or OpenVPN's crypto code.  Since it is a self-test mode,
problems with encryption and authentication can be debugged independently
of network and tunnel issues.
.SS TLS Mode Options:
TLS mode is the most powerful crypto mode of OpenVPN in both security and flexibility.
TLS mode works by establishing control and
data channels which are multiplexed over a single TCP/UDP port.  OpenVPN initiates
a TLS session over the control channel and uses it to exchange cipher
and HMAC keys to protect the data channel.  TLS mode uses a robust reliability
layer over the UDP connection for all control channel communication, while
the data channel, over which encrypted tunnel data passes, is forwarded without
any mediation.  The result is the best of both worlds: a fast data channel
that forwards over UDP with only the overhead of encrypt,
decrypt, and HMAC functions,
and a control channel that provides all of the security features of TLS,
including certificate-based authentication and Diffie Hellman forward secrecy.

To use TLS mode, each peer that runs OpenVPN should have its own local
certificate/key pair (
.B --cert
and
.B --key
), signed by the root certificate which is specified
in
.B --ca.

When two OpenVPN peers connect, each presents its local certificate to the
other.  Each peer will then check that its partner peer presented a
certificate which was signed by the master root certificate as specified in
.B --ca.

If that check on both peers succeeds, then the TLS negotiation
will succeed, both OpenVPN
peers will exchange temporary session keys, and the tunnel will begin
passing data.

The OpenVPN distribution contains a set of scripts for
managing RSA certificates & keys,
located in the
.I easy-rsa
subdirectory.

The easy-rsa package is also rendered in web form here:
.I http://openvpn.sourceforge.net/easyrsa.html
.TP
.B --tls-server
Enable TLS and assume server role during TLS handshake.  Note that
OpenVPN is designed as a peer-to-peer application.  The designation
of client or server is only for the purpose of negotiating the TLS
control channel.
.TP
.B --tls-client
Enable TLS and assume client role during TLS handshake.
.TP
.B --ca file
Certificate authority (CA) file in .pem format, also referred to as the
.I root
certificate.  This file can have multiple
certificates in .pem format, concatenated together.  You can construct your own
certificate authority certificate and private key by using a command such as:

.B openssl req -nodes -new -x509 -keyout tmp-ca.key -out tmp-ca.crt

Then edit your openssl.cnf file and edit the
.B certificate
variable to point to your new root certificate
.B tmp-ca.crt.

For testing purposes only, the OpenVPN distribution includes a sample
CA certificate (tmp-ca.crt).
Of course you should never use
the test certificates and test keys distributed with OpenVPN in a
production environment, since by virtue of the fact that
they are distributed with OpenVPN, they are totally insecure.
.TP
.B --dh file
File containing Diffie Hellman parameters
in .pem format (required for
.B --tls-server
only). Use

.B openssl dhparam -out dh1024.pem 1024

to generate your own, or use the existing dh1024.pem file
included with the OpenVPN distribution.  Diffie Hellman parameters
may be considered public.
.TP
.B --cert file
Local peer's signed certificate in .pem format -- must be signed
by a certificate authority whose certificate is in
.B --ca file.
Each peer in an OpenVPN link running in TLS mode should have its own
certificate and private key file.  In addition, each certificate should
have been signed by the key of a certificate
authority whose public key resides in the
.B --ca
certificate authority file.
You can easily make your own certificate authority (see above) or pay money
to use a commercial service such as thawte.com (in which case you will be
helping to finance the world's second space tourist :).
To generate a certificate,
you can use a command such as:

.B openssl req -nodes -new -keyout mycert.key -out mycert.csr

If your certificate authority private key lives on another machine, copy
the certificate signing request (mycert.csr) to this other machine (this can
be done over an insecure channel such as email).  Now sign the certificate
with a command such as:

.B openssl ca -out mycert.crt -in mycert.csr

Now copy the certificate (mycert.crt)
back to the peer which initially generated the .csr file (this
can be over a public medium).
Note that the
.B openssl ca
command reads the location of the certificate authority key from its
configuration file such as
.B /usr/share/ssl/openssl.cnf
-- note also
that for certificate authority functions, you must set up the files
.B index.txt
(may be empty) and
.B serial
(initialize to
.B 
01
).
.TP
.B --key file
Local peer's private key in .pem format.  Use the private key which was generated
when you built your peer's certificate (see
.B -cert file
above).
.TP
.B --key-method m
Use data channel key negotiation method
.B m.
The key method must match on both sides of the connection.

After OpenVPN negotiates a TLS session, a new set of keys
for protecting the tunnel data channel is generated and
exchanged over the TLS session.

In method 1 (the default), both sides generate
random encrypt and HMAC-send keys which are forwarded to
the other host over the TLS channel.

In method 2, the client generates a random key.  Both client
and server also generate some random seed material.  All key source
material is exchanged over the TLS channel. The actual
keys are generated using the TLS PRF function, taking source
entropy from both client and server.  Method 2 is designed to
closely parallel the key generation process used by TLS 1.0.
.TP
.B --tls-cipher l
A list
.B l
of allowable TLS ciphers delimited by a colon (":").
If you require a high level of security,
you may want to set this parameter manually, to prevent a
version rollback attack where a man-in-the-middle attacker tries
to force two peers to negotiate to the lowest level
of security they both support.
Use
.B --show-tls
to see a list of supported TLS ciphers.
.TP
.B --tls-timeout n
Packet retransmit timeout on TLS control channel
if no acknowledgment from remote within
.B n
seconds (default=2).  When OpenVPN sends a control
packet to its peer, it will expect to receive an
acknowledgement within
.B n
seconds or it will retransmit the packet, subject
to a TCP-like exponential backoff algorithm.  This parameter
only applies to control channel packets.  Data channel
packets (which carry encrypted tunnel data) are never
acknowledged, sequenced, or retransmitted by OpenVPN because
the higher level network protocols running on top of the tunnel
such as TCP expect this role to be left to them.
.TP
.B --reneg-bytes n
Renegotiate data channel key after
.B n
bytes sent or received (disabled by default).
OpenVPN allows the lifetime of a key
to be expressed as a number of bytes encrypted/decrypted, a number of packets, or
a number of seconds.  A key renegotiation will be forced
if any of these three criteria are met by either peer.
.TP
.B --reneg-pkts n
Renegotiate data channel key after
.B n
packets sent and received (disabled by default).
.TP
.B --reneg-sec n
Renegotiate data channel key after
.B n
seconds (default=3600).
.TP
.B --hand-window n
Handshake Window -- the TLS-based key exchange must finalize within
.B n
seconds
of handshake initiation by any peer (default = 60 seconds).
If the handshake fails
we will attempt to reset our connection with our peer and try again.
Even in the event of handshake failure we will still use
our expiring key for up to
.B --tran-window
seconds to maintain continuity of transmission of tunnel
data.
.TP
.B --tran-window n
Transition window -- our old key can live this many seconds
after a new a key renegotiation begins (default = 3600 seconds).
This feature allows for a graceful transition from old to new
key, and removes the key renegotiation sequence from the critical
path of tunnel data forwarding.
.TP
.B --single-session
After initially connecting to a remote peer, disallow any new connections.
Using this
option means that a remote peer cannot connect, disconnect, and then
reconnect.

If the daemon is reset by a signal or
.B --ping-restart,
it will allow one new connection.

.B --single-session
can be used with
.B --ping-exit
or
.B --inactive
to create a single dynamic session that will exit when finished.
.TP
.B --tls-auth file [direction]
Add an additional layer of HMAC authentication on top of the TLS
control channel to protect against DoS attacks.

In a nutshell,
.B --tls-auth
enables a kind of "HMAC firewall" on OpenVPN's TCP/UDP port,
where TLS control channel packets
bearing an incorrect HMAC signature can be dropped immediately without
response.

.B file
(required) is a key file which can be in one of two formats:

.B (1)
An OpenVPN static key file generated by
.B --genkey
(required if
.B direction
parameter is used).

.B (2)
A freeform passphrase file.  In this case the HMAC key will
be derived by taking a secure hash of this file, similar to
the
.BR md5sum (1)
or
.BR sha1sum (1)
commands.

OpenVPN will first try format (1), and if the file fails to parse as
a static key file, format (2) will be used.

See the
.B --secret
option for more information on the optional
.B direction
parameter.

.B --tls-auth
is recommended when you are running OpenVPN in a mode where
it is listening for packets from any IP address, such as when
.B --remote
is not specified, or
.B --remote
is specified with
.B --float.

The rationale for
this feature is as follows.  TLS requires a multi-packet exchange
before it is able to authenticate a peer.  During this time
before authentication, OpenVPN is allocating resources (memory
and CPU) to this potential peer.  The potential peer is also
exposing many parts of OpenVPN and the OpenSSL library to the packets
it is sending.  Most successful network attacks today seek
to either exploit bugs in programs (such as buffer overflow attacks) or
force a program to consume so many resources that it becomes unusable.
Of course the first line of defense is always to produce clean,
well-audited code.  OpenVPN has been written with buffer overflow
attack prevention as a top priority.
But as history has shown, many of the most widely used
network applications have, from time to time,
fallen to buffer overflow attacks.

So as a second line of defense, OpenVPN offers
this special layer of authentication on top of the TLS control channel so that
every packet on the control channel is authenticated by an
HMAC signature and a unique ID for replay protection.
This signature will also help protect against DoS (Denial of Service) attacks.
An important rule of thumb in reducing vulnerability to DoS attacks is to
minimize the amount of resources a potential, but as yet unauthenticated,
client is able to consume.

.B --tls-auth
does this by signing every TLS control channel packet with an HMAC signature,
including packets which are sent before the TLS level has had a chance
to authenticate the peer.
The result is that packets without
the correct signature can be dropped immediately upon reception,
before they have a chance to consume additional system resources
such as by initiating a TLS handshake.
.B --tls-auth
can be strengthened by adding the
.B --replay-persist
option which will keep OpenVPN's replay protection state
in a file so that it is not lost across restarts.

It should be emphasized that this feature is optional and that the
passphrase/key file used with
.B --tls-auth
gives a peer nothing more than the power to initiate a TLS
handshake.  It is not used to encrypt or authenticate any tunnel data.
.TP
.B --askpass
Get PEM password from controlling tty before we daemonize.  For the extremely
security conscious, it is possible to protect your private key with
a password.  Of course this means that every time the OpenVPN
daemon is started you must be there to type the password.  The
.B --askpass
option allows you to start OpenVPN from the command line.  It will
query you for a password before it daemonizes.  To protect a private
key with a password you should omit the
.B -nodes
option when you use the
.B openssl
command line tool to manage certificates and private keys.
.TP
.B --tls-verify cmd
Execute shell command
.B cmd
to verify the X509 name of a
pending TLS connection that has otherwise passed all other
tests of certification.
.B cmd
should return 0 to allow the TLS handshake to proceed, or 1 to fail.
.B cmd
is executed as

.B cmd certificate_depth X509_NAME_oneline

See the "Environmental Variables" section below for
additional parameters passed as environmental variables.

Note that
.B cmd
can be a shell command with multiple arguments, in which
case all OpenVPN-generated arguments will be appended
to
.B cmd
to build a command line which will be passed to the script.

This feature is useful if the peer you want to trust has a certificate
which was signed by a certificate authority who also signed a zillion
other certificates.  In this case you want to be selective about which
peer certificate you accept.  This feature allows you to write a script
which will test the X509 name on a certificate and decide whether or
not it should be accepted.  For a simple perl script which will test
the common name field on the certificate, see the file
.B verify-cn
in the OpenVPN distribution.
.TP
.B --tls-remote x509name
Accept connections only from a host with X509 name
.B x509name.
The remote host must also pass all other tests
of verification.

This is an useful replacement for the
.B --tls-verify
option to verify the remote host, because
.B --tls-remote
works in a
.B --chroot
environment too.
.TP
.B --crl-verify crl
Check peer certificate against the file
.B crl
in PEM format.

A CRL (certificate revocation list) is used when a particular key is
compromised but when the overall PKI is still intact.

Suppose you had a PKI consisting of a CA, root certificate, and a number of
client certificates.  Suppose a laptop computer containing a client key and
certificate was stolen.  By adding the stolen certificate to the CRL file,
you could reject any connection which attempts to use it, while preserving the
overall integrity of the PKI.

The only time when it would be necessary to rebuild the entire PKI from scratch would be
if the root certificate key itself was compromised.

.
.TP
.B --secret file
Write key to
.B file.
.SS TUN/TAP persistent tunnel config mode:
Available with linux 2.4.7+.  These options comprise a standalone mode
of OpenVPN which can be used to create and delete persistent tunnels.
.TP
.B --mktun
Create a persistent tunnel on platforms which support them such
as Linux.  Normally TUN/TAP tunnels exist only for
the period of time that an application has them open.  This option
takes advantage of the TUN/TAP driver's ability to build persistent
tunnels that live through multiple instantiations of OpenVPN and die
only when they are deleted or the machine is rebooted.

One of the advantages of persistent tunnels is that they eliminate the
need for separate
.B --up
and
.B --down
scripts to run the appropriate
.BR ifconfig (8)
and
.BR route (8)
commands.  These commands can be placed in the the same shell script
which starts or terminates an OpenVPN session.

Another advantage is that open connections through the TUN/TAP-based tunnel
will not be reset if the OpenVPN peer restarts.  This can be useful to
provide uninterrupted connectivity through the tunnel in the event of a DHCP
reset of the peer's public IP address (see the
.B --ipchange
option above).

One disadvantage of persistent tunnels is that it is harder to automatically
configure their MTU value (see
.B --link-mtu
and
.B --tun-mtu
above).

On some platforms such as Windows, TAP-Win32 tunnels are persistent by
default.
.TP
.B --rmtun
Remove a persistent tunnel.

.SS Windows-Specific Options:
.TP
.B --ip-win32 method
When using
.B --ifconfig
on Windows, set the TAP-Win32 adapter
IP address and netmask using
.B method.
Don't use this option unless you are also using
.B --ifconfig.

.B manual --
Don't set the IP address or netmask automatically.
Instead output a message
to the console telling the user to configure the
adapter manually and indicating the IP/netmask which
OpenVPN expects the adapter to be set to.

.B dynamic [offset] [lease-time] --
(Default) Automatically set the IP address and netmask by replying to
DHCP query messages generated by the kernel.  This mode is
probably the "cleanest" solution
for setting the TCP/IP properties since it uses the well-known
DHCP protocol.  There are, however, two prerequisites for using
this mode: (1) The TCP/IP properties for the TAP-Win32
adapter must be set to "Obtain an IP address automatically," and
(2) OpenVPN needs to claim an IP address in the subnet for use
as the virtual DHCP server address.  By default in
.B --dev tap
mode, OpenVPN will
take the normally unused first address in the subnet.  For example,
if your subnet is 192.168.4.0 netmask 255.255.255.0, then
OpenVPN will take the IP address 192.168.4.0 to use as the
virtual DHCP server address.  In
.B --dev tun
mode, OpenVPN will cause the DHCP server to masquerade as if it were
coming from the remote endpoint.  The optional offset parameter is
an integer which is > -256 and < 256 and which defaults to 0.
If offset is positive, the DHCP server will masquerade as the IP
address at network address + offset.
If offset is negative, the DHCP server will masquerade as the IP
address at broadcast address + offset.  The Windows
.B ipconfig /all
command can be used to show what Windows thinks the DHCP server
address is.  OpenVPN will "claim" this address, so make sure to
use a free address.  Having said that, different OpenVPN instantiations,
including different ends of the same connection, can share the same
virtual DHCP server address.  The
.B lease-time
parameter controls the lease time of the DHCP assignment given to
the TAP-Win32 adapter, and is denoted in seconds.
Normally a very long lease time is preferred
because it prevents routes involving the TAP-Win32 adapter from
being lost when the system goes to sleep.  The default
lease time is one year.

.B netsh --
Automatically set the IP address and netmask using
the Windows command-line "netsh"
command.  This method appears to work correctly on
Windows XP but not Windows 2000.

.B ipapi --
Automatically set the IP address and netmask using the
Windows IP Helper API.  This approach
does not have ideal semantics, though testing has indicated
that it works okay in practice.  If you use this option,
it is best to leave the TCP/IP properties for the TAP-Win32
adapter in their default state, i.e. "Obtain an IP address
automatically."
.TP
.B --dhcp-option type [parm]
Set extended TAP-Win32 TCP/IP properties, must
be used with
.B --ip-win32 dynamic.
This option can be used to set additional TCP/IP properties
on the TAP-Win32 adapter, and is particularly useful for
configuring an OpenVPN client to access a Samba server
across the VPN.

.B DOMAIN name --
Set Connection-specific DNS Suffix.

.B DNS addr --
Set primary domain name server address.  Repeat
this option to set secondary DNS server addresses.

.B WINS addr --
Set primary WINS server address (NetBIOS over TCP/IP Name Server).
Repeat this option to set secondary WINS server addresses.

.B NBDD addr --
Set primary NBDD server address (NetBIOS over TCP/IP Datagram Distribution Server)
Repeat this option
to set secondary NBDD server addresses.

.B NTP addr --
Set primary NTP server address (Network Time Protocol).
Repeat this option
to set secondary NTP server addresses.

.B NBT type --
Set NetBIOS over TCP/IP Node type.  Possible options:
.B 1
= b-node (broadcasts),
.B 2
= p-node (point-to-point
name queries to a WINS server),
.B 4
= m-node (broadcast
then query name server), and
.B 8
= h-node (query name server, then broadcast).

.B NBS scope-id --
Set NetBIOS over TCP/IP Scope. A NetBIOS Scope ID provides an extended
naming service for the NetBIOS over TCP/IP (Known as NBT) module. The
primary purpose of a NetBIOS scope ID is to isolate NetBIOS traffic on
a single network to only those nodes with the same NetBIOS scope ID.
The NetBIOS scope ID is a character string that is appended to the NetBIOS
name. The NetBIOS scope ID on two hosts must match, or the two hosts
will not be able to communicate. The NetBIOS Scope ID also allows
computers to use the same computer name, as they have different
scope IDs. The Scope ID becomes a part of the NetBIOS name, making the name unique.

.TP
.B --tap-sleep n
Cause OpenVPN to sleep for
.B n
seconds immediately after the TAP-Win32 adapter state
is set to "connected".

This option is intended to be used to troubleshoot problems
with the
.B --ifconfig
and
.B --ip-win32
options, and is used to give
the TAP-Win32 adapter time to come up before
Windows IP Helper API operations are applied to it.
.TP
.B --show-adapters
Show available TAP-Win32 adapters which can be selected using the
.B --dev-node
option.  On non-Windows systems, the
.BR ifconfig (8)
command provides similar functionality.
.TP
.B --show-valid-subnets
Show valid subnets for
.B --dev tun
emulation.  Since the TAP-Win32 driver
exports an ethernet interface to Windows, and since TUN devices are
point-to-point in nature, it is necessary for the TAP-Win32 driver
to impose certain constraints on TUN endpoint address selection.

Namely, the point-to-point endpoints used in TUN device emulation
must be the middle two addresses of a /30 subnet (netmask 255.255.255.252).
.TP
.B --pause-exit
Put up a "press any key to continue" message on the console prior
to OpenVPN program exit.  This option is automatically used by the
Windows explorer when OpenVPN is run on a configuration
file using the right-click explorer menu.
.SH SCRIPTING AND ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
Starting with 1.5-beta7, OpenVPN now exports a series
of environmental variables for use by
.B --up, --down, --ipchange, --tls-verify
or
.B --route-up
scripts.
.SS Script Order of Execution
.TP
.B --up
Executed after TCP/UDP socket bind and TUN/TAP open.
.TP
.B --tls-verify
Executed when we have a still untrusted remote peer.
.TP
.B --ipchange
Executed after connection authentication, or remote IP address change.
.TP
.B --route-up
Executed after connection authentication, either
immediately after, or some number of seconds after
as defined by the
.B --route-delay
option.
.TP
.B --down
Executed after TCP/UDP and TUN/TAP close.
.SS Environmental Variables
Once set, a variable is persisted
indefinitely until it is reset by a new value or a restart,
so for example an
.B --ipchange
script could take advantage of variables set prior to the
.B --up
script executing.  This could be done even if there is no
.B --up
script since all variables are set whether or not the script
they are connected with is enabled.
.TP
.B config
Name of first
.B --config
file.  Set on program initiation and reset on SIGHUP.
.TP
.B dev
The actual name of the TUN/TAP device, including
a unit number if it exists.
Set prior to
.B --up
or
.B --down
script execution.
.TP
.B ifconfig_broadcast
The broadcast address for the virtual
ethernet segment which is derived from the
.B --ifconfig
option when
.B --dev tap
is used.
Set prior to OpenVPN calling the
.I ifconfig
or
.I netsh
(windows version of ifconfig) commands which
normally occurs prior to
.B --up
script execution.
.TP
.B ifconfig_local
The local VPN endpoint IP address specified in the
.B --ifconfig
option (first parameter).
Set prior to OpenVPN calling the
.I ifconfig

.SH SIGNALS
.TP
.B SIGHUP
Cause OpenVPN to close all TUN/TAP and
network connections,
restart, re-read the configuration file (if any),
and reopen TUN/TAP and network connections.
.TP
.B SIGUSR1
Like 
.B SIGHUP,
except don't re-read configuration file, and possibly don't close and reopen TUN/TAP
device, re-read key files, preserve local IP address/port, or preserve most recently authenticated
remote IP address/port based on
.B --persist-tun, --persist-key, --persist-local-ip,
and
.B --persist-remote-ip
options respectively (see above).

This signal may also be internally generated by a timeout condition, governed
by the
.B --ping-restart
option.

This signal, when combined with
.B --persist-remote-ip,
may be
sent when the underlying parameters of the host's network interface change
such as when the host is a DHCP client and is assigned a new IP address.
See
.B --ipchange
above for more information.
.TP
.B SIGUSR2
Causes OpenVPN to display its current statistics (to the syslog
file if
.B --daemon
is used, or stdout otherwise).
.TP
.B SIGINT, SIGTERM
Causes OpenVPN to exit gracefully.
.SH TUN/TAP DRIVER SETUP
If you are running Linux 2.4.7 or higher, you probably have the TUN/TAP driver
already installed.  If so, there are still a few things you need to do:

Make device:
.B mknod /dev/net/tun c 10 200

Load driver:
.B modprobe tun

If you have Linux 2.2 or earlier, you should obtain version 1.1 of the
TUN/TAP driver from
.I http://vtun.sourceforge.net/tun/
and follow the installation instructions.
.SH EXAMPLES
Prior to running these examples, you should have OpenVPN installed on two
machines with network connectivity between them.  If you have not
yet installed OpenVPN, consult the INSTALL file included in the OpenVPN
distribution.
.SS TUN/TAP Setup:
If you are using Linux 2.4 or higher,
make the tun device node and load the tun module:
.IP
.B mknod /dev/net/tun c 10 200
.LP
.IP
.B modprobe tun
.LP
If you installed from RPM, the
.B mknod
step may be omitted, because the RPM install does that for you.

If you have Linux 2.2, you should obtain version 1.1 of the
TUN/TAP driver from
.I http://vtun.sourceforge.net/tun/
and follow the installation instructions.

For other platforms, consult the INSTALL file at
.I http://openvpn.sourceforge.net/install.html
for more information.
.SS Firewall Setup:
If firewalls exist between
the two machines, they should be set to forward UDP port 5000
in both directions.  If you do not have control over the firewalls
between the two machines, you may still be able to use OpenVPN by adding
.B --ping 15
to each of the
.B openvpn
commands used below in the examples (this will cause each peer to send out
a UDP ping to its remote peer once every 15 seconds which will cause many
stateful firewalls to forward packets in both directions
without an explicit firewall rule).

If you are using a Linux iptables-based firewall, you may need to enter
the following command to allow incoming packets on the TUN device:
.IP
.B iptables -A INPUT -i tun+ -j ACCEPT
.LP
See the firewalls section below for more information on configuring firewalls
for use with OpenVPN.
.SS VPN Address Setup:
For purposes
of our example, our two machines will be called
.B may.kg
and
.B june.kg.
If you are constructing a VPN over the internet, then replace
.B may.kg
and
.B june.kg
with the internet hostname or IP address that each machine will use
to contact the other over the internet.

Now we will choose the tunnel endpoints.  Tunnel endpoints are
private IP addresses that only have meaning in the context of
the VPN.  Each machine will use the tunnel endpoint of the other
machine to access it over the VPN.  In our example,
the tunnel endpoint for may.kg
will be 10.4.0.1 and for june.kg, 10.4.0.2.

Once the VPN is established, you have essentially
created a secure alternate path between the two hosts
which is addressed by using the tunnel endpoints.  You can
control which network
traffic passes between the hosts 
(a) over the VPN or (b) independently of the VPN, by choosing whether to use
(a) the VPN endpoint address or (b) the public internet address,
to access the remote host. For example if you are on may.kg and you wish to connect to june.kg
via
.B ssh
without using the VPN (since
.B ssh
has its own built-in security) you would use the command
.B ssh june.kg.
However in the same scenario, you could also use the command
.B telnet 10.4.0.2
to create a telnet session with june.kg over the VPN, that would
use the VPN to secure the session rather than
.B ssh.

You can use any address you wish for the
tunnel endpoints
but make sure that they are private addresses
(such as those that begin with 10 or 192.168) and that they are
not part of any existing subnet on the networks of
either peer.  If you use an address that is part of
your local subnet for either of the tunnel endpoints,
you will get a weird feedback loop.
.SS Example 1: A simple tunnel without security
.LP
On may:
.IP
.B openvpn --remote june.kg --dev tun1 --ifconfig 10.4.0.1 10.4.0.2 --verb 9
.LP
On june:
.IP
.B openvpn --remote may.kg --dev tun1 --ifconfig 10.4.0.2 10.4.0.1 --verb 9
.LP
Now verify the tunnel is working by pinging across the tunnel.
.LP
On may:
.IP
.B ping 10.4.0.2
.LP
On june:
.IP
.B ping 10.4.0.1
.LP
The
.B --verb 9
option will produce verbose output, similar to the
.BR tcpdump (8)
program.  Omit the
.B --verb 9
option to have OpenVPN run quietly.
.SS Example 2: A tunnel with static-key security (i.e. using a pre-shared secret)
First build a static key on may.
.IP
.B openvpn --genkey --secret key
.LP
This command will build a random key file called
.B key
(in ascii format).
Now copy
.B key
to june over a secure medium such as by
using the
.BR scp (1)
program.
.LP
On may:
.IP
.B openvpn --remote june.kg --dev tun1 --ifconfig 10.4.0.1 10.4.0.2 --verb 5 --secret key
.LP
On june:
.IP
.B openvpn --remote may.kg --dev tun1 --ifconfig 10.4.0.2 10.4.0.1 --verb 5 --secret key
.LP
Now verify the tunnel is working by pinging across the tunnel.
.LP
On may:
.IP
.B ping 10.4.0.2
.LP
On june:
.IP
.B ping 10.4.0.1
.SS Example 3: A tunnel with full TLS-based security
For this test, we will designate
.B may
as the TLS client and
.B june
as the TLS server.
.I Note that client or server designation only has meaning for the TLS subsystem.  It has no bearing on OpenVPN's peer-to-peer, UDP-based communication model.

First, build a separate certificate/key pair
for both may and june (see above where
.B --cert
is discussed for more info).  Then construct
Diffie Hellman parameters (see above where
.B --dh
is discussed for more info).  You can also use the
included test files client.crt, client.key,
server.crt, server.key and tmp-ca.crt.
The .crt files are certificates/public-keys, the .key
files are private keys, and tmp-ca.crt is a certification
authority who has signed both
client.crt and server.crt.  For Diffie Hellman
parameters you can use the included file dh1024.pem.
.I Note that all client, server, and certificate authority certificates and keys included in the OpenVPN distribution are totally insecure and should be used for testing only.
.LP
On may:
.IP
.B openvpn --remote june.kg --dev tun1 --ifconfig 10.4.0.1 10.4.0.2 --tls-client --ca tmp-ca.crt --cert client.crt --key client.key --reneg-sec 60 --verb 5
.LP
On june:
.IP
.B openvpn --remote may.kg --dev tun1 --ifconfig 10.4.0.2 10.4.0.1 --tls-server --dh dh1024.pem --ca tmp-ca.crt --cert server.crt --key server.key --reneg-sec 60 --verb 5
.LP
Now verify the tunnel is working by pinging across the tunnel.
.LP
On may:
.IP
.B ping 10.4.0.2
.LP
On june:
.IP
.B ping 10.4.0.1
.LP
Notice the
.B --reneg-sec 60
option we used above.  That tells OpenVPN to renegotiate
the data channel keys every minute.
Since we used
.B --verb 5
above, you will see status information on each new key negotiation.

For production operations, a key renegotiation interval of 60 seconds
is probably too frequent.  Omit the
.B --reneg-sec 60
option to use OpenVPN's default key renegotiation interval of one hour.
.SS Routing:
Assuming you can ping across the tunnel,
the next step is to route a real subnet over
the secure tunnel.  Suppose that may and june have two network
interfaces each, one connected
to the internet, and the other to a private
network.  Our goal is to securely connect
both private networks.  We will assume that may's private subnet
is 10.0.0.0/24 and june's is 10.0.1.0/24.
.LP
First, ensure that IP forwarding is enabled on both peers.
On Linux, enable routing:
.IP
.B echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
.LP
and enable TUN packet forwarding through the firewall:
.IP
.B iptables -A FORWARD -i tun+ -j ACCEPT
.LP
On may:
.IP
.B route add -net 10.0.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 10.4.0.2
.LP
On june:
.IP
.B route add -net 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 10.4.0.1
.LP
Now any machine on the 10.0.0.0/24 subnet can
access any machine on the 10.0.1.0/24 subnet
over the secure tunnel (or vice versa).

In a production environment, you could put the route command(s)
in a shell script and execute with the
.B --up
option.
.SH FIREWALLS
OpenVPN's usage of a single UDP port makes it fairly firewall-friendly.
You should add an entry to your firewall rules to allow incoming OpenVPN
packets.  On Linux 2.4+:
.IP
.B iptables -A INPUT -p udp -s 1.2.3.4 --dport 5000 -j ACCEPT
.LP
This will allow incoming packets on UDP port 5000 (OpenVPN's default UDP port)
from an OpenVPN peer at 1.2.3.4.

If you are using HMAC-based packet authentication (the default in any of
OpenVPN's secure modes), having the firewall filter on source
address can be considered optional, since HMAC packet authentication
is a much more secure method of verifying the authenticity of
a packet source.  In that case:
.IP
.B iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 5000 -j ACCEPT
.LP
would be adequate and would not render the host inflexible with
respect to its peer having a dynamic IP address.

OpenVPN also works well on stateful firewalls.  In some cases, you may
not need to add any static rules to the firewall list if you are
using a stateful firewall that knows how to track UDP connections.
If you specify
.B --ping n,
OpenVPN will be guaranteed
to send a packet to its peer at least once every
.B n
seconds.  If
.B n
is less than the stateful firewall connection timeout, you can
maintain an OpenVPN connection indefinitely without explicit
firewall rules.

You should also add firewall rules to allow incoming IP traffic on
TUN or TAP devices such as:
.IP
.B iptables -A INPUT -i tun+ -j ACCEPT
.LP
to allow input packets from tun devices,
.IP
.B iptables -A FORWARD -i tun+ -j ACCEPT
.LP
to allow input packets from tun devices to be forwarded to
other hosts on the local network,
.IP
.B iptables -A INPUT -i tap+ -j ACCEPT
.LP
to allow input packets from tap devices, and
.IP
.B iptables -A FORWARD -i tap+ -j ACCEPT
.LP
to allow input packets from tap devices to be forwarded to
other hosts on the local network.

These rules are secure if you use packet authentication,
since no incoming packets will arrive on a TUN or TAP
virtual device
unless they first pass an HMAC authentication test.
